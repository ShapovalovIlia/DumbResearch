It's about the Monte Carlo chess engine. In the first slide, I well, I mentioned the fact there is a Monte Carlo chess engine. And I'm gonna use, like, a hybrid AI approach, which uses the Monte Carlo tree search and also Stockfish. First of all, to test the first version of it by just playing games which Stockfish suggests. And then also finally having something to play against as well. To to see how strong the final version of the engine is. Okay. So why why did I choose chess and machine learning? Well, it's it's simple, really. It's like I like the game. Kind of dislike it, but like it at the same time. We played it for many years and want to create a a good engine. So it's something I'll be wanting to make for many years as well. So it'd be a good challenge in the last year of university.

The next slide, I show the architecture of the game using the, the Java code. UML tree. So users it shows what I've written so far, the various classes and everything like that. The the that's the game logic. And the AI integration and the data structures, which is what's written in the slide. So, yeah, basically, at the board the chessboard, showing all the pieces and the legal moves that they can make. Right. And then, also the multi color tree search algorithm, which isn't done yet, but that's gonna be done on the side. And then but also the tree. Cause it does need a tree. So that's more like the data structures part. Alright. Then we also have JavaFX and Stockfish integration next. In other words, that's the the graphical user interface, which uses JavaFX. And then Stockfish, which is written in c plus plus. So I connect by JML. The, the c plus plus code so it can run it in Java. So that was that was quite a challenge there, and that's what I go over here. And I also mentioned the graphical user interface. And, also, the the graphics which are shown the program because it's all kind of like a neat chessboard, graphics. There's like a blank board and then the various pieces pieces as pings. They can be moved around the board. So it's aesthetically pleasing, which yeah, that's the one I've made so far. After that, I go over the Nut Beans Java engine. The code that's written in NetBeans rather. And I'll show the the chessboard class. On the side of this slide. Showing the various functions which are in place already. So that's the the largest class which is written so far. Yep. And then I go on to mention the we've gone over the basics stage. So now we're going to over the intermediate stage. That is to develop a Monte Carlo tree search and mention how that works. It produces a tree, and then it plays a series of random moves, something like five. And in the end, we're gonna get to, like, plus one or minus one depending on whether it's winning or losing. And then we play multiple strings of random moves. And then we find the mean of it. Other words, if the most plus one, then it'll be a positive number. If the most mostly negative one, It'll be negative numbers. That'll be the sum, not the mean. Sorry. The sum of them together. See if it's positive or In other words, learning whether it's a a good move by chance playing, which is why it's called Monte Carlo. It's kinda gambles. It finds something which works. Alright. The final step in the way is to well, we'll put all that together. I think I I think I do mention things a few times in the slides as well."},"models":{"prosody":{"scores":{"admiration":0.05755615234375,"adoration":0.0151214599609375,"aestheticAppreciation":0.038818359375,"amusement":0.07196044921875,"anger":0.0305938720703125,"anxiety":0.0221099853515625,"awe":0.0127716064453125,"awkwardness":0.06268310546875,"boredom":0.01873779296875,"calmness":0.08154296875,"concentration":0.34814453125,"confusion":0.0206298828125,"contemplation":0.2357177734375,"contempt":0.033050537109375,"contentment":0.056396484375,"craving":0.0132904052734375,"desire":0.0048370361328125,"determination":0.194580078125,"disappointment":0.036163330078125,"disgust":0.015228271484375,"distress":0.018768310546875,"doubt":0.026885986328125,"ecstasy":0.0134124755859375,"embarrassment":0.0123748779296875,"empathicPain":0.006595611572265625,"entrancement":0.00848388671875,"envy":0.01153564453125,"excitement":0.09722900390625,"fear":0.00910186767578125,"guilt":0.004322052001953125,"horror":0.004108428955078125,"interest":0.2509765625,"joy":0.044647216796875,"love":0.007251739501953125,"nostalgia":0.0248260498046875,"pain":0.003002166748046875,"pride":0.09161376953125,"realization":0.055694580078125,"relief":0.01557159423828125,"romance":0.004852294921875,"sadness":0.00922393798828125,"satisfaction":0.0887451171875,"shame":0.006275177001953125,"surpriseNegative":0.0112152099609375,"surprisePositive":0.02093505859375,"sympathy":0.0099639892578125,"tiredness":0.007305145263671875,"triumph":0.043975830078125}}},"time":{"begin":177940,"end":321190},"fromText":false,"interim":false,"receivedAt":"2024-12-26T23:48:02.354Z"},{"type":"assistant_message","id":"1fe93a5a159f4f83b7fa2dba5df9a747","message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Overall,
