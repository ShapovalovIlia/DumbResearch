3.92,"Okay, this time I would like to learn how to find a Nash equilibrium in game theory."
18.72,Tell me how to find Nash equilibrium.
22.64,Let's start by simple and dive deeper.
26.37,Deeper.
37.89,"Okay, it says to understand with the structure represent the game."
43.01,"Okay, the valuable point here is building a payoff matrix."
46.746,One step.
49.138,"The next step, check if the equilibrium even exists."
55.46,Okay.
60.74,"Okay, let's say I don't know how to utilize the mixed strategies."
64.412,What is the mixed strategies?
79.79,"Oh, basically so."
81.278,"Okay, from what I understood, the mixed strategies is when we assign some probability to any of the available moves of the player and then we calculate the total payoff."
98.67,Okay.
102.67,Or here is considered the games like rock paper systems.
105.574,I guess I will never ever lose it again.
108.79,Funny.
110.39,"Okay, how to calculate the mixed."
120.526,Mixed.
121.67,From what I understood there is pure Nash equilibrium and mixed Nash equilibrium.
127.678,How to calculate mixed Nash equilibrium Understand the game.
150.018,"Okay, write the payoff matrix."
153.258,Define mixed strategy.
155.41,Assign probabilities.
157.018,"Okay, as I've said, use different condition."
163.41,"Okay, everything, all of that."
167.73,"Okay, we see the example who's matching pennies?"
174.53,How do I build the payoff matrix?
178.33,If there is let's say three players from what I understood because the building a payoff metrics is crucial.
198.53,More than two players ident.
209.282,"Okay, identifying the strategies."
212.42,"List strategies for every player, number of strategies available to every."
224.94,"Okay, from what I understand, the more players you have, the more matrixes you just built."
230.54,You cannot suppress it in a one huge matrix.
235.26,"Okay, this is understandable."
240.04,"Okay, let's then."
241.208,Let's then try to calculate the pure mix the Nash equilibrium on a.
248.36,In a game where there are more than three players.
251.224,Let's say the game is of the four players.
259.0,Find the Nash equilibrium in the game with four players and construct payoff metrics.
284.54,Let's see defining four players.
290.292,All possible strategies for the players.
292.402,"Okay, as I said, as was said previously, building."
296.834,Ah.
297.17,"Okay, building this strategy profile."
302.53,"To be honest, I don't understand much what is going on."
321.02,The essential tools will be symbolic solvers in Matlab.
333.74,"Okay, to be honest, I don't understand this."
339.82,Please explain simpler.
354.74,"Okay, it will now it stated well, now it's explained a bit more about assigning the payoffs."
364.26,"Well, it helps, but not that much, to be honest."
372.67,Okay.
373.174,Where I can learn about it.
410.84,"Okay, I will open the."
412.712,"Okay, I will definitely take a look at the Han Academy."
420.85,Let's summarize it.
433.25,Summarize all the previous information.
454.62,Why actually it is even important to find Nash Equivia.
458.86,Why is it?
487.43,"Okay, from what I understand, we will definitely need Nash Equilibrium to find the logical way to predict and understand the strategic behavior in various fields."
507.67,"But okay, to be honest, I haven't utilized it ever in the real life."
515.59,Maybe that's why it's a bit difficult for me to understand how to use it properly.
