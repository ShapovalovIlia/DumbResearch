5.12,"Okay, I would like to learn again about the greedy algorithm."
17.12,Tell me about greedy algorithm.
35.13,"I see the data regarding the key characteristics, how it works, feasibility, advantages and disadvantages."
47.37,Okay.
50.65,And I see the examples of the greedy algorithms.
55.65,"Cruise, skulls, prims."
63.81,"Okay, show me the use."
69.09,There is a common knapsack problem.
71.282,I would like to see how the greedy algorithm is used on the knapsack problem.
79.33,Show me on the simple example how nap of simple example of greedy algorithm used on a knapsack problem.
112.03,"Okay, we see the very basic example with the nav stack with the capacity of 50 and the three items with the assigned weight and values."
125.31,The solution will be to take first and second item and take only two thirds of the item number three.
138.46,"Well, okay, understandable."
145.58,Let's see it on a more advanced example.
154.86,"No, actually I would like to see the examples where the greedy algorithm does not work, in which situations greedy algorithm is a bad choice."
199.88,"Okay, for example, well, it explains again on a knapsack problem, for example, if it's a one problem where we cannot take fractions of items, greedy approach may fail."
212.808,"Okay, okay."
219.03,"Well, in then if the greedy algorithm does not work, what do we need to use?"
241.68,"But to be honest, my purpose is just to learn about the greedy algorithm."
247.352,"Let's say, where can I practically learn about greedy algorithm?"
271.35,"Coursera, Adex, Udemy."
273.806,"Well, I won't use the udemy since I need to pay for it."
279.35,"Coding platforms, leet code, delete code is good."
285.046,"Okay, the lead code can be used."
292.56,Actually there is a website W three schools haven't used it in a while.
299.04,Is there anything about the greedy algorithm?
303.88,Let's ask that.
310.88,Can I learn about it on W33 schools?
322.73,"Ah, yeah."
323.458,It's in a data structures and algorithm tutorial.
327.85,But I believe there is a very basic knowledge of that.
332.09,"Okay, then let's move on."
341.63,Is the greedy algorithm used nowadays?
347.79,Is the greedy.
352.83,Rhythm used today?
364.83,"Well, it is interesting."
367.158,"It's used in network and communication and load balancing, scheduling and resource allocation."
381.28,"Okay, I understand how it's used in a job scheduling, activities, financial system."
388.864,"Well, obviously financial system, artificial intelligence, graphics and gaming."
396.81,"Okay, not going to dive deep in that."
410.81,Just to clarify the last question.
412.938,Are there better algorithms in general?
433.26,"Okay, I guess I haven't."
446.22,I see.
447.67,"Well, yeah, my question wasn't right because the algorithm cannot be worse or better."
457.398,It depends on the problem.
459.59,"Yeah, this chatgpt is right."
463.19,"Okay, I'm satisfied with that answer."
466.31,"Actually, where can I learn."
