64.71,Okay.
66.014,"Well, interesting."
68.63,It does not tell me to dedicate a big chunk of time for it.
76.07,"On the contrary, it recommends to split in a small 15 to 20 minutes periods."
85.12,"Well, okay, maybe let's clarify this moment."
94.08,Is it okay to learn it in such small time frames?
113.47,"Well, it says it will be extremely."
116.11,Extremely.
119.63,"Oh, so it bases it."

127.07,"Yeah, well, I've heard of that."
129.15,It says that it will help to memorize it better.
133.83,But actually what will be the workload?
136.766,How long do I need to learn it?
143.19,How long will it take me to learn?
159.37,"Okay, so basically what it did it."
162.394,"Oh, it says that there are like different."
165.13,There are different.
166.378,The all languages in the world are divided on the levels of difficulties.
172.17,And it says that Arabic is as difficult as Chinese and Japanese.

194.9,"Well, definitely it will require the daily practice."

199.86,But okay.
202.988,There is a useful tip about immersion.
207.78,It says that watching shows and using apps like Tandem will help a lot.
217.95,Okay.
219.158,"If it is the whole time to needed to learn the language, how long, let's say it will take me to learn the Alphabet?"
247.17,"Well, again, it divided all the languages on the."
250.69,"On the scale of difficulty, two, three weeks will be more than enough to read and write comfortably."
263.89,Aha.
266.13,"Well, how long?"
268.53,"Well, okay, initially I wanted to ask about how long will it take me to read?"
274.05,How long will it take to pronounce it correctly?
278.41,Because from what I know there are some syllables and some letters that are extremely unusual for non native speakers to pronounce.
299.77,How long will it take to.
301.738,How long will it take to pronounce everything correctly?
315.45,"Well, oh, since I'm a Russian speaker, it says that for me it will be."

331.784,"For example, this Spanish speakers or Italian speakers."
335.96,"Well, that's interesting."
338.12,And it will take up to two years for natural pronunciation.

352.05,Not gonna lie.
356.13,Okay.
358.29,"But oh, there is an interesting point."
361.794,"Let's compare for example, how many words there are in English vocabulary and how many words are in Arab vocabulary."
388.35,"This is difficult to measure, but still it's."
396.84,"Oh, there is a huge difference."
401.4,"The English has approximately over a million words, while Arabic has more than 12 million words."
411.8,"Well, I believe that this is a huge difference, but the active vocabulary is on For English it's like 20, 30 thousands and for Arabic it's up to 70,000."
423.874,"Well, at least."
424.658,So at least twice or tries the amount of the English words.
428.874,"Okay, I guess that's this language is very difficult to learn."
433.25,"Okay, but okay."
434.618,At least I got the basic understanding of what I need to do and how much time I should dedicate for it and to set my expect expectations correctly.
445.73,I don't think it is possible to learn it as quickly as for example Spanish.
