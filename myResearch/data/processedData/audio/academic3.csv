4.08,"Okay, I would like to build the."
5.872,I would like to build a blockchain framework for supply chain management.
14.08,Help me to build blockchain framework supply chain management.
37.8,Let's see where we should start.
46.2,"Okay, definitely we will focus on building the blockchain layer and the network architecture."
54.73,I'm not gonna go deep in exploring what the supply chain management is and what are the current existing systems.
64.13,"First of all, for sure we know that it is beneficial."
69.37,Let's first of all point out what is the more the biggest advantages of the blockchain framework.
77.86,Blockchain.
103.27,Let's figure the biggest benefits.
112.63,"Well, as expected, it will be a combination of qualities such as transparency, traceability and efficiency."
120.31,Trust and cost savings.
122.622,"Well, I'm not sure about exactly the cost savings."
126.39,"Maybe adopting this technology might be expensive at the very beginning, but later on I'm not sure."
136.56,"Okay, let's say for example if I would like to build it for a corporation like Walmart, let's say where I should start."
158.16,Let's say I want to build it for Walmart.
165.6,What should I do?
166.688,What do I need to do?
167.68,"First, I know that there are ERT like Enterprise Research Planning planners and I know that every company has dozens of them and they hardly link with each other."
192.62,"Well, going back to our question, Understanding warmth, needs and goes."
199.988,"Etc, etc."
207.59,"Yeah, okay."
208.926,Doesn't remember how can we link it with existing ERT systems?
228.87,"Oh, erp."
229.966,Enterprise Resource Planning.
239.67,"Okay, I've seen the smart contracts previously use the API."
248.63,"Okay, well let's first of all how expensive it is."
263.84,"I mean like if it is extremely expensive so that it won't be used within like next few decades, there is no point in developing it."
272.624,"First of all, let's clarify by if there are."
280.064,Is there any companies using data.
283.76,"Let's ask this, are there any companies, any companies using it already?"
297.78,"To be honest, I don't think so because the technology is very advanced."
302.74,"Well, it says Walmart but I'm not sure."
305.844,"Let's just Unilever, K4, Nestle, DHL."
312.352,"Well, there are the huge companies using it."
314.616,"Pfizer, Alibaba, Amazon."
320.04,Let's ask is it primary primary way to manage supply chains in those companies?
342.39,Maybe it's like just a demo.
350.15,Why?
350.55,"As it was predicted, blockchain is not primary way."
358.39,What are the current limitations?
361.75,Why it's not used everywhere?
364.83,The advantage like the benefits are obvious and they're extremely needed.
371.734,Why we do not utilize them?
380.83,What are the current problems with integrating blockchain solution?
396.98,"Technical challenges, Scalability."
399.46,"Okay, I do not understand about the scalability."
402.3,I thought it's one of the advantages of the Bitcoin.
406.26,Let's clarify that.
413.78,What are the problems with scalability and integrity?
428.79,Let's specify a bit more low throughput.
440.95,Okay.
443.86,"Oh, high energy consumption."
445.868,"Well, this is understandable."
448.02,"Data volume, cost."
450.74,Cost is understandable as well.
453.94,Everything needs money.
460.58,"Yes, I understand now the problem with the data."
464.5,The blockchain cannot verify the accuracy because the data will be entered by participants and you cannot fully control the participants.
473.526,"So the problem with the integrity, with the integrity of data still remains."
478.326,"Okay, now I understand it."
480.302,Okay.
480.758,My understanding of how to solve this problem is better.
484.91,Okay.
